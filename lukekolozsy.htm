<h1 style="color:cornsilk;text-align:center;">The Not-so-Great Luke Kolozsy</h1>
<p style="color:white;">You know that guy Luke Kolozsy, yeah he is not that guy pal. I heard that one time he went 10 under the speed limit. 
Not to be  D1 hater or anything, but sometimes I wish he would just stop talking, like honestly, stop the yapping. He ain't got no one in his DMS, he's just straight up lying about that. Bro actually made seperate accounts just to make posts about himself. 
I bet you didn't even know that he was the reason no one could buy a PS5. He had actual bots buy them all just to re-sell them.</p>

<p style="color:white;">In all seriousness though, he actually is the G.O.A.T. I just made up a bunch of stuff to make him look bad. He IS da G.O.A.T. Put some repect on his name unlike me.
