<h1 style="color:cornsilk;text-align:center;">The Great Luke Kolozsy</h1>
<p style="color:white;">You know that guy Luke Kolozsy, yeah he is just so amazing. I heard that one time he saved a ton of puppies from a flash flood, like that is just so flipping brave. 
Not to be  D1 glazer or anything, but sometimes I wish I would switch places with him, like honestly, his life is just so much cooler than mine. He got Sydney Sweeny, Zendaya, and Isabella Merced all up in his DMs. He doesn't even talk about it to the public or anything, he is just so humble and nonchalant. 
I bet you didn't even know that he bought SpaceX, like he is just so humble that he didn't even make a big deal out of it.</p>

<p style="color:white;">In all seriousness though, he is just the G.O.A.T. Many people don't acually see him in person just because he's so mysterious and chill like that, but I met him and what he did for me was on god the dopest thing anyone's done for me. Bro hooked me up with his ex Dove Cameron. Like only the G.O.A.T. does that type shi.</p>
